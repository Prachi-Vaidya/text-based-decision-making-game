Subject: Urgent Request

Mr. Victor Sterling,

Since my mother's passing, I face daunting financial challenges. Your bond with her holds immense value, and I find myself in a vulnerable position. Your name was synonymous with trust in her eyes.
I appeal to that trust, hoping you'll consider including me in your will. Your acknowledgment would not only alleviate my financial strain but honor the enduring legacy of your connection with my late mother.

I approach this request with humility, understanding its sensitivity, and sincerely hope you'll grant me the solace and security I seek in this uncertain time.

Respectfully,

David Lewis
